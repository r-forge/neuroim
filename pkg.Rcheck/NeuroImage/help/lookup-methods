_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     a function that is used internally to convert between 1d indices
     and lookup kys for sparse data structures

_M_e_t_h_o_d_s:



     _x = "_I_n_d_e_x_L_o_o_k_u_p_V_o_l_u_m_e", _i = "_n_u_m_e_r_i_c" takes 1d index vector and
          returns a sequence of lookup indices 

     _x = "_S_p_a_r_s_e_B_r_a_i_n_V_e_c_t_o_r", _i = "_n_u_m_e_r_i_c" takes 1d index vector and
          returns a sequence of lookup indices
