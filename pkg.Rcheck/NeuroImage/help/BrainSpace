_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     Dim: an integer vector supplying the dimensions of the image grid  

  origin: a numeric vector with 'length' equal to 'Dim' represting
          image origin in mm 

 spacing: the cell (pixel or voxel) size for each dimension in mm 

orientation: a character vector representing anatomical orientation of
          the grid axes  

   trans: a transformation matrix used to convert grid positions to
          real world coordinates 

 reptime: the delay in seconds between successive volume acquisitions 

_V_a_l_u_e:

     an object of class "BrainSpace"
