_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This class is used to store two-dimensional image data
     representing a single cut or slice through a brain volume

     Objects can be created by calls of the form ' BrainSlice(data,
     space)'

_S_l_o_t_s:


     '._D_a_t_a': Object of class '"array"' inherited data slot from
          "array" class. In this class, however, array data is always
          two-dimensional 

     '_s_p_a_c_e': Object of class '"BrainSpace"' inherited slot from
          virtual class "BrainData" 

_E_x_t_e_n_d_s:

     Class '"array"', from data part. Class '"BrainData"', directly.
     Class '"structure"', by class "array", distance 2. Class
     '"matrix"', by class "array", distance 2, with explicit test and
     coerce. Class '"vector"', by class "array", distance 3, with
     explicit coerce. Class '"vector"', by class "array", distance 4,
     with explicit test and coerce. Class '"vector"', by class "array",
     distance 5, with explicit test and coerce.

_M_e_t_h_o_d_s:


     _i_n_d_e_x_T_o_V_o_x_e_l 'signature(x = "BrainSlice", idx = "index")': - maps
          from a one-dimensional index to a two-dimensional pixel/voxel
          coordinate

          "index")': - convert from a two-dimensional coordinate to
          one-dimensional index
