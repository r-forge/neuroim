_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     creation fucntion for a BrainRegion3D class that is a cube.

_U_s_a_g_e:

      RegionCube(bvol, centroid, surround, mask) 

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    bvol: the 'BrainVolume' that on which the geometry of the region is
          based 

centroid: the center coordinates (in grid space) of the region 

surround: the number of surrounding voxels on each side of the center
          voxel 

    mask: a mask supplied as a 3d array the same shape as 'bvol' that
          will be used to exlucde voxels in the cube that fall outside
          the mask
