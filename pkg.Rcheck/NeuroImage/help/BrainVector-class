_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     a class for storing an array or sequence of image volumes, such as
     fMRI data

     Objects can be created by calls of the form 'new("BrainVector",
     ...)'.

_S_l_o_t_s:


     '._D_a_t_a': Object of class '"array"' : the stored image data 

     '_s_p_a_c_e': Object of class '"BrainSpace"' : the geometry of the
          image volumes, which must be identical for images in the
          sequence
