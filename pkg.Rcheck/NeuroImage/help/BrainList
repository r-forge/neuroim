_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     This class is used for storing related collections of brain
     images. It is simply a class extending 'list' and 'BrainData'. For
     instance, one may represent a set of MRIs across a group of
     subjects, each having the same geometry, as a "BrainList". Unlike,
     'BrainVector' instances, which are stored as arrays and suitable
     for representing multi-dimensional images such as FMRI
     time-series, 'BrainList' objects are better suited for loose,
     possibly unordered collections of related data sets. Thus,
     "BrainList" objects are closely related to "bucket" data sets in
     AFNI.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     an object of class "BrainList"
